# Vector-Channels-HAL
Vector Channeling Hal

NOTE:  You will need to have the Anki Vector SDK installed on your PC in order to run this script.  The SDK can be found at:
https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/initial.html

To run successfully, you will need both hal.py and Hal.jpg files.

Also note, as of Anki Vector SDK Ver 0.5.1, Python programs should not be run while the Anki Vector smart phone app is connected to Vector.  On rare occasions, the Python code will run (or portions will execute) but it is highly recommended that you close the Vector smart phone app before executing any Python code that connects to Vector.
